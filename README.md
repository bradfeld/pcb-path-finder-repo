# PCB Path Finder

A Python implementation of a path-finding algorithm for PCB routing between components.

All the code was generated using Console and the AI Composer Feature

There are three separate projects:
- pcb-path-finder: Claude Sonnet 3.5
- pcb-path-finder-o1: o1-mini
- pcb-path-finder-gais: Google AI Studio

## Features
- Finds paths between pins on different components
- Ensures paths only use horizontal and vertical segments
- Avoids component collisions
- Includes visualization of components and routing with interactive tooltips
